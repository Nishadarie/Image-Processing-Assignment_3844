1. Reduce Intensity Levels
Converts an image from 256 intensity levels to 2.
If the user inputs 3, the output will have 8 intensity levels (2³=8).

2. Spatial Averaging (Mean Filtering)
Applies a 3×3, 10×10, and 20×20 averaging filter to blur the image.

3. Image Rotation
Rotates the image by 45° and 90° .

4. Block Averaging (Resolution Reduction)
Divides the image into non-overlapping blocks (3×3, 5×5, 7×7) and replaces each block with its average intensity.
